## 7. Risk Assessment

### 7.1 Limited Access
- Description: Unable to test backend or admin areas that require special permissions
- Likelihood: High
- Severity: Medium

### 7.2 Data Limitations
- Description: Cannot test with a wide range of real user test data
- Likelihood: High
- Severity: Medium

### 7.3 Transaction Restrictions
- Description: Unable to complete actual purchases
- Likelihood: High
- Severity: High

### 7.4 Time Sensitivity
- Description: Features or UI may change during the testing period without notice
- Likelihood: Medium
- Severity: Low

### 7.5 Device Coverage
- Description: Testing limited to available personal devices, may not cover all user scenarios
- Likelihood: High
- Severity: Medium


## 8. Out of Scope
- Real transactions
- Backend performance testing
- Mobile application
- Anything related to working as Wolt Courier (different part of the website)


## 9. Test Approach

### Manual Testing
- Exploratory testing to catch unexpected behaviors
- Cross-browser and device compatibility checks
- General user experience checks
- Other cases that are impossible to cover with automation

### Automation Testing
- Automation will cover most functional tests unless not possible to automate
- Tests will be converted in to regression test suite after execution for the future
- Selenium will be used due to prior knowledge and ease of use
