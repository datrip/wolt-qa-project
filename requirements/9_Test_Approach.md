## 9. Test Approach

### Manual Testing
- Exploratory testing to catch unexpected behaviors
- Cross-browser and device compatibility checks
- General user experience checks
- Other cases that are impossible to cover with automation

### Automation Testing
- Automation will cover most functional tests unless not possible to automate
- Tests will be converted in to regression test suite after execution for the future
- Playwright will be used due to prior knowledge and ease of use
